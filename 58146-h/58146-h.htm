v</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Never</span> in the history of this
country has literature assumed so prominent a position as it does
at the present time; not in one department only, but in the ample
circle she travels, each presenting its own peculiar claims to
attention and regard, thus catering to the diversified
necessities of the human family.</p>
<p>Among the various intellectual viands, none is more generally
acceptable than History; and simply for this reason, in other
departments or productions of the pen we have abstract principles
and theories, which require to be worked out by mental or manual
processes ere they assume a form to be capable of appreciation by
the general mind.&nbsp; In History truths are progressively
elaborated and developed under the immediate influence of time
and circumstances, by which their qualities become known, and
their value tested and proved.</p>
<p>In the first class we may be said to have presented to us a
subtle spirit so ethereal and liable to evaporation as to be
difficult of retention to any important purpose, and so versatile
as to be susceptible of any form at the will of the operator; in
the latter we possess a definite tangible reality, in which we
see reflected as in a mirror the principles, feelings, motives,
and results, not only of the several actors, but of the times in
which they lived, all which become fixed or Daguerreotyped for
the benefit of those that come after.</p>
<p><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>The
term History is of a general and extensive character, admitting
of a very minute subdivision.&nbsp; In the first place it may be
simple or compound, pure or mixed, as it embraces persons, times,
or things, taken singly or in their combination in the mutual
influence they exert.&nbsp; This is the general form in which it
is presented.&nbsp; In the next place, it may range as universal,
national, provincial, local, or individual.&nbsp; Another
division will give us civil, political, ecclesiastical: each of
these have their intrinsic value, will materially influence the
progress of civilisation, and promote the well-being of society;
but to the last, viz., ecclesiastical, there belongs a charm
pre-eminently its own, as it closely approximates to
eternity.</p>
<p>The following History is of the mixed class, as the Table of
Contents will show, so that it is hoped, while it may possess or
create a general interest, its specific features will please
others; and its ecclesiastical lineaments afford to the devout
mind great gratification.</p>
<p>The Author craves the indulgence of his readers, and hopes his
efforts will receive a general verdict of approbation.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>SECTION
I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Etymology of the place&mdash;Its
situation&mdash;Geological
characters&mdash;Antiquity&mdash;Architectural
features&mdash;Traditions&mdash;Commercial status.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">East</span>, or as it is sometimes
denominated, <span class="smcap">Market Lavington</span>, distant
from London 89 miles, is situated about the middle, rather
inclining to the western, part of the county of Wiltshire, on the
north side of the extensive downs celebrated for the relics of a
barbaric age, when human victims were supposed to appease the
anger of the gods, of which a distant view is obtained on the
road from Salisbury, near the Bustard Inn, so called from a bird
once found on this plain.&nbsp; It graced the table of the new
Mayor of Salisbury in former times on the day of his election to
the civic office; but is now obsolete.&nbsp; The hunting of this
bird once constituted a chief amusement to the neighbouring
gentry.&nbsp; Lavington runs in a north-easterly direction,
forming a portion of the celebrated Vale of Pewsey, reckoned the
best and most fertile part of the county.</p>
<p>The etymology of this place like that of many others has
probably suffered by local corruptions, it is <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>either of Saxon
or Norman origin&mdash;a word compounded of two others,
<i>Lav</i> or <i>Lave</i> and <i>ton</i>.&nbsp; The former might
describe its position, the latter its quality or nature.</p>
<p>The names of places are frequently very descriptive of their
situation, as Wilton, near Salisbury, or, as it known in ancient
records, Willytown&mdash;the town on the Willy, a river running
through it to Salisbury, where it unites with other streams, and
flows into the English Channel at Christchurch.&nbsp; We propose
to take this as our guide on the present occasion, and establish
our hypothesis by several concurrent facts.</p>
<p>The term <i>Lav</i> or <i>Lave</i> may either mean
watered&mdash;washed, left, or hidden; and the termination
<i>ton</i>, which is a very general one, a town, as Easterton,
Littleton, Maddington, and Shrewton.</p>
<p>Situated as Lavington is at the foot of the downs, which rise
to a considerable altitude above it, with hills on the opposite
side of nearly equal height, seen from either it appears to lie
in a complete basin, every way adapted to act as a drain or
receiver of water from the uplands&mdash;a fact illustrated in
the years 1841&ndash;2, when a great destruction of property-took
place at Shrewton, through inundations occasioned by the
accumulation of water by the rapid thawing of the snow in various
natural basins in the vicinity, as at Candown Bottom and other
places.&nbsp; The soil of the valley, so favourable to the
cultivation of edible roots, being marked by the combined
characters of the surrounding barriers.</p>
<p>In some parts of the kingdom there are places where
well-defined and specific geological features conduct to certain
conclusions, such as the primeval deposits of virgin
soil&mdash;the annual product of rank foliage where the foot of
man for ages never trod, which, when brought to tillage, yields
successive crops of abundance&mdash;the subsidence of a vast and
overwhelming inundation&mdash;the retreat of the watery <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>element after
ages of possession, leaving its hitherto submerged bed high and
dry.&nbsp; As an illustration, we may refer to the subsoil of
Bath, which is stone of so friable a nature as to be easily
affected by the elements, and, if examined, will be found a
combination of various shells, which plainly tell its former
state, or the severance of some great and terrible convulsion,
forming vast chasms, and exhibiting the various strata of rocks
far down in the womb of the earth.&nbsp; There is a very good
display of this at villas in the neighbourhood of Frome,
Somersetshire, and at Clifton Hotwells, near Bristol, or in
places round the Isle of Wight, and in the coal-fields at
Radstock, and each of these present their own peculiar
characters; but here we have on either side of the valley a
separate and distinct formation.&nbsp; The downs predominate in
chalk, on a stony brackish soil, with but a thin layer of
vegetable earth on a substratum of flint and gravel; the
exception of the hollows no way interfering with the general
state.&nbsp; On the opposite side there is sand to the depth of
several feet resting upon sandstone, with occasional layers of
granite, then again sand and sandstone, ultimating in a subsoil
of granite, and this extends for several miles.&nbsp; The
washings of the two barriers by the repeated rains, together with
the humid atmosphere, so striking a character in the climate of
this country, combining in various degrees, produces the fertile
soil of the valley from the sandy loam to the stiff clay.</p>
<p>If we recur to the times of invasion when hordes of barbarians
sought the subjugation of this island, the predatory warfare with
the ravages to which the inland parts of the country were
exposed, there would naturally be a disposition and desire of
secrecy and seclusion.&nbsp; Now no place could be better adapted
for this purpose, surrounded as it is by the uplands before
referred to, lying, too, at a distance from the <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>main road on
either hand, and possessing within itself the chief resources of
subsistence, it could remain unknown as long as needful.&nbsp; We
must remember, when speaking of by-gone times their facilities of
information were very rude and simple.&nbsp; How, in the absence
of the appliances of transit and intercommunication which we
possess, they would denote the direction of various towns we know
not; their proximity to certain well known objects, or as
occupying particular situations, might afford them means and
facilities, especially if we allow the progress of
improvement.&nbsp; Let us apply this theory in the present case,
and it might be the town left on quitting the downs, and emerging
towards the chief towns, as Bath, or the last town prior to
ascending them.&nbsp; The name, therefore might mean the washed
or watered&mdash;the hidden or left town.</p>
<p>As but very few of the older buildings remain, and what
traditions there are being very vague, it is impossible to fix
the date of its formation.&nbsp; The church, of which we shall
speak more fully elsewhere, has doubtless stood for some hundreds
of years.&nbsp; The old parsonage, with its gables and
cress-muntained windows, carries the visitor into by-gone
times.&nbsp; A large mansion on the road to Urchfont, at the turn
to Eastcott, has undoubtedly the marks of age; its ponderous
appearance, numerous gables, heavy stacks of chimnies, and
ballustraded gallery&mdash;tell of times when profuse hospitality
was common.&nbsp; There is one at Easterton, of which we have
more definite accounts: it is now in the occupation of Mr.
Neville.&nbsp; Report states it to have been erected by the
Protector, Oliver Cromwell, about the year 1657, for his general,
Kinson; and to which he himself oft repaired, either when
commanding in the wars between Charles II. and the parliament (of
whose armies Cromwell was commander-in-chief), one of which took
place at Bratton, about eight miles <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>distant, a spot celebrated from the
time of Alfred the Great, where, after rallying his troops at
Clay hill, near Frome, he gave the Danes battle and routed them,
the spot is shown where the Danes encamped and where Alfred
penetrated in the disguise of an harper,&mdash;or probably the
Protector here sought for seclusion and rest to a mind perturbed
and alarmed to suspicion by the publication of a work, supposed
to allude to him, entitled, &ldquo;Killing no Murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Wroughton&rsquo;s Folly there are remains of a once
extensive erection, which, from its size, would have accommodated
a numerous family.&nbsp; Its picturesque situation, surrounded
with extensive grounds, formed a charming retreat; it was
occupied by a retired merchant, but has long gone to decay.&nbsp;
Report states the ruins were once the retreat of a daring
freebooter, who preyed upon the surrounding homesteads and laid
under contribution the yeoman as he returned from the
neighbouring markets: little now remains save the foundations of
the cellars.&nbsp; Near this spot are three mounds within a small
enclosure in the middle of a field, of which tradition thus
speaks:&mdash;In the time of Charles II., when that dreadful
scourge, the plague, which destroyed upwards of one hundred
thousand of the inhabitants of London, broke out, three brothers,
seeking to avoid the common lot, fled to this spot, thinking
thereby to escape, but they were overtaken by the fell destroyer,
and buried here.</p>
<p>Lavington was formerly distinguished for its corn market and
the manufacture of malt, in which articles business to a very
considerable extent was transacted; this gave it the appellative
attached.&nbsp; Its proximity to the rising town of Devizes soon
reduced it to its present condition; it is now generally known
for its large supplies of vegetables to the market of Devizes,
distant 6 miles,&mdash;Trowbridge, 12 miles,&mdash;Bath, 22
miles,&mdash;and Salisbury, <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>19 miles.&nbsp; The market-place
continues to maintain its former dimensions, and constitutes the
favourite resort of the juvenile portion of the population.&nbsp;
The stocks, once a terror and punishment to evildoers, have lost
their dread, and the clanking iron has become a musical
instrument in their estimation.&nbsp; Near this is the
Engine-house, a wooden erection, with a cupulo for a bell whose
tongue is happily seldom inclined to speak, the services of the
engine is seldom required; fire, as an element of alarm, being of
very rare occurrence.&nbsp; The population of the place,
including the hamlet of Easterton, is 1700; and the area of the
parish about 3036 acres to Lavington, and 1592 to Easterton.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Ecclesiastical and Denominational
accommodation&mdash;Literary and other
advantages&mdash;Educational facilities&mdash;Scenery.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> place is included within the
diocese of Salisbury, and has a church of considerable antiquity,
dating somewhere between 1360 and 1380, most probably the time of
Edward III.&nbsp; It was built by the Roman Catholics, and
dedicated to St. Michael, and is in the gift of Christchurch
college, Oxford.&nbsp; Its style of architecture is a mixture;
there are some parts appearing older than the main building,
which would lead to the supposition of a prior edifice; the
striking features denote the time of transition from the plain
English to that of the decorated, but some parts are of very
recent construction.&nbsp; It consists of a chancel of about 42
ft. by 18&frac12; ft.; a nave, 54 ft. by 51 ft.; and a square
tower, 17 ft. by 18 ft.; and will accommodate about 600
people.&nbsp; The chancel, which has been recently renovated, is
inlaid with encaustic tiles; and here are several marble
monumental tablets to the relics of the Sainburys; one especially
with a full-length female figure to Thomas Twice, sheriff, and
once Lord Mayor of London; and another to Mr. Merewether, father
of the town clerk of the same place.&nbsp; The tower is an
embattled one, having a ring of six bells.&nbsp; Beneath it are
two or three records of munificence; one a bequest by &mdash;
Tanner, formerly vicar of this parish, afterwards Bishop of St.
Asaph, to the following effect:&mdash;To the minister for a
sermon annually, &pound;1; for the purchase of four bibles for
the use of the poor, &pound;1; for the education of three
children, &pound;1; a dinner for the respectable inhabitants,
&pound;1; the ringers for two short peals, 6s.; the sexton and
clerk, 5s.&nbsp; A gilt tablet to this worthy man is placed in
the nave, <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>near the chancel.&nbsp; The other bequest is by two
brothers, of &pound;100 each in the consols; the interest to be
distributed in bread to the poor.&nbsp; Beneath the tower is a
stone font with a carved oak lid, the work of a self-taught
artist, a native of Bath; presented to the church by Mr.
Stubbart.&nbsp; This edifice is situated at the west end of the
place on rising ground, and forms a conspicuous object in all
directions.&nbsp; With this is connected a handsome building for
the use of the day school, which is conducted upon the plan of
the national system, numbering 90 boys and 75 girls; and a
Sabbath school, numbering 180 boys, 170 girls, and 17
teachers.</p>
<p>There is also a respectable Dissenting cause, dating from the
year 1801, when a church was formed upon the platform of the
Independent or Congregational order.&nbsp; Their place of worship
is at the east end of the town; its dimensions are 33 ft. by 42
ft., and it is capable of holding between four and five hundred
of this cause: a fuller account will be given in the subsequent
pages.&nbsp; They have connected with them a good Sabbath school,
numbering 60 boys, 70 girls, and 13 teachers.&nbsp; A British and
Foreign day school was established, but various circumstances
having militated against its progress and success, it has
declined, and is at the present time carried on as a private
undertaking.&nbsp; With the Independents is associated a Dorcas
Society, consisting of twelve subscribers, a number of whom meet
once a month to make garments, which are given away to the poor
of the place.&nbsp; There is also a society organised in

Baptist interests of high Calvinistic principles and maintaining
close communion, are situated in the lower parts of the town; one
in a lane near the weighing engine, and chiefly supplied by
lay-agents from the neighbourhood; the congregation exceeds in
number one hundred, and there are twenty members; the building
measures about 30 ft. by 28 ft.: the other, which is an offshoot,
has recently been erected; it is but small, measuring 30 ft. by

not exceed one hundred, and has but few members; it has a

<p>The Primitive Methodists have for some time laboured here;
they formerly had a flourishing society of thirty members, but
have declined, owing to the difficulty of obtaining a suitable
place; their present number is probably about ten.&nbsp; They
form part of the Newbury circuit.</p>
<p>A Temperance Society, established in the year 1838, has been
the means of considerable good, reclaiming several persons who
were reduced to a state of poverty and ruin, restoring and
elevating them to comfort and respectability.&nbsp; The

circulate tracts and advance their views by occasionally holding
meetings.</p>
<p>Reading-rooms are open for the accommodation of subscribers,
where the daily and weekly papers with other works are supplied;
and where, during the winter months, lectures are occasionally
delivered upon literary and scientific subjects: they are

Market-place.</p>
<p>An Horticultural Society has lately sprung up for encouraging
the cultivation of fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; Prizes are
awarded to the successful competitors at the annual exhibition,

<p>The facilities for intercommunication are good.&nbsp; A coach
from Salisbury to Chippenham passes through West Lavington,
distant one mile, every alternate day, returning the following;
and one recently started leaves here for the Hungerford extension
line each alternate day in time for the up train, and leaves on
its return on the following, upon the arrival of the down
train.&nbsp; There is also a daily carrier to Devizes, and two to
Salisbury weekly.</p>
<p>A small stream rises at the farther end of Easterton, and
supplies the sheet of water in the grounds at Fiddington (where
there is a pleasant and comfortable asylum for
lunatics),&mdash;winds to Northbrook&mdash;passes on through the
meads at Ladywood to Russell mill, where it joins another stream
(which rises at Newlam, a mile from West Lavington; this formerly
covered a space of seven acres, but is now reduced to very narrow
limits)&mdash;united in one it pursues its way towards Bath and
Bristol, where it falls into the Avon and Severn.&nbsp; A branch
which turns off towards Devizes empties itself into the Avon and
Kennet canal; in its progress it forms the moving power to
several mills, and imparts fertility to the various meads in its
course.</p>
<p>The scenery around is of the most delightful character, the
sands or common have been successfully brought into cultivation,
and where formerly but few buildings appeared numerous houses
have been erected, which bespeak the efforts of the humble
classes to attain respectability and comfort; while the tillage
constantly going on gives great animation to the scene.&nbsp; The
country around is everywhere well wooded to the north, and may
with propriety be termed a panorama, reaching to the <a

the atmosphere is clear, and with the aid of good glasses, the
Welsh mountains may be descried.&nbsp; A good eye will be able to
discover Lansdown and the Beckford monument, Stourton Tower, and
the spire of Salisbury Cathedral.&nbsp; The most favourable
points of observation are the downs on the top of Lavington hill,
Wroughton&rsquo;s Folly, and Ledgehill, on the road to Bath and
Devizes, there are a few spots possessing a romantic feature,
exhibiting as they do high walls of strata surmounted with tall
waving foliage.&nbsp; Here the lover and copyist of nature might
revel in perfect delight, and gather many a sketch for his
portfolio.&nbsp; About some 25 years ago the approaches were
everywhere impeded by toll-gates, the heavy expenses thereby
entailed upon the farmer and gentry led to vigorous efforts for
their removal by liberal contributions to a fund for this
purpose, they were bought up, and in one day no less than twelve
of these impediments were destroyed.&nbsp; The event is annually
commemorated by a public dinner at the chief inn and a bonfire in
the evening.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Past religious state&mdash;Feeble
instrumentality of its reformation&mdash;<span
class="smcap">David Saunders</span>, the pious Shepherd of
Salisbury Plain&mdash;His early life&mdash;Correction of error in
former narratives.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> reference to the former
religious state of this place the picture is a truly gloomy
one&mdash;a common ruin of all that is holy seems to have
pervaded society from the highest to the lowest; nor did the
condition appear to awaken any concern&mdash;bull and badger
baiting, cock and dog fighting, with all their concomitant evils,
depravity of manners, pugilistic encounters, drunkenness and
profanity, were the characteristics of the people, not of the
lower classes only, but also the middle and upper, and not only
sanctioned but encouraged by the clergy; to such an extent did
this run, that a notoriety rested upon the place and its
inhabitants for miles round.&nbsp; It is true the Society of
Friends had long possessed a place of worship here, but little
benefit resulted to the morals of the people.&nbsp; The peculiar
tenets held by them, together with other circumstances, tended to
their decline, public service was confined to periodical
assemblings, called quarterly district meetings, the funeral of
friends, or the visits of some of their principal speakers.</p>
<p>In the Establishment the teaching was a meagre maudling
something, for neither in precept or example could it be called
religion, or even morality.&nbsp; Its quality was of the same
stamp as that which generally pervaded the discourses of the
clergy of that day, and which diffused its baneful seeds over the
country at large, such as might be expected, where the sports of
the field, the facilities for angling, and the pleasures of
good-fellowship were objects of pre-eminent attraction to
clerical ambition.&nbsp; The submission of <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the poor to
their superiors; reverence and obedience to the commands of the
priesthood; abject veneration for the Established Church;
punctuality in attendance on her rites and ceremonies, with a
full and prompt discharge of all her dues; these were the staple
of her instructions, and all that was required by her to
constitute a good man, a Christian, and to entitle him to heaven;
while every effort made to instruct and enlighten the mind
received the whole weight of her opposition and anathema, as it
was considered far preferable that the population be left in the
grossest darkness, perfectly and profoundly ignorant of the
claims of God, so besotted in vice were they, that to be the best
fighter, to have the best bulldog, to possess the finest game
bird, or to have won the prize in any of the sports was the
highest felicity and enjoyment their minds could desire or
appreciate.</p>
<p>As in many of the most important conveniences and improvements
of civilised life, the origin or spring has been insignificant
and comparatively obscure, surrounded with every disadvantage and
impediment to success; so also has it been with our most valuable
religious movements, &ldquo;For God hath chosen the foolish
things of this world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen
the weak things of the world to confound the things that are
mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are
despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to
bring to nought things that are: that no flesh should glory in
his presence.&rdquo; <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; Look at the
great moral and spiritual reformation which commenced in the year
1503, when a change took place in Germany, agitating the whole
Christian world, shaking the papal kingdom from the centre to the
circumference, opening to the light its secret <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>abominations,
overturning its iniquitous customs, irradiating its darkest
recesses, and pouring its healing waters into the abodes of
suffering and woe.&nbsp; And what was the immediate instrument,
and who was the artificer selected or raised up to accomplish
this?&nbsp; The prohibited volume of the Holy Scripture, which
had long lain on the shelves of the library at the Augustine
monastery at Erfurt&mdash;here Martin Luther, a monk, found it,
secretly he conveyed it to his cell, and amid the solemn silence
and darkness of night, his solitary lamp tells his employment,
and aids him in exploring the mine of truth, the record of
eternal life.&nbsp; Celestial light diffused itself through his
mind, illumined his soul, and wrought strong convictions that the
principles and practices of that Church, of which he was the
avowed and sworn servant, were at perfect variance with
truth.&nbsp; Arrayed against him as was the whole hierarchy of
that apostate Church, he clothed himself in the panoply of the
Gospel, especially &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit, which is the
word of God,&rdquo; to do warfare in the sacred cause.</p>
<p>So here an obscure peasant, inhabiting a cot so lowly that
those accustomed to more convenient and comfortable accommodation
would be disposed to spurn the humble abode as a mere hovel unfit
for human dwelling; whose days are devoted to toil amid exposure
to all the varying influences of weather, the father of a large
and increasing family, whose wants might plead excuse, and claim
his undivided attention, together with a heavily afflicted wife,
whose ill-health prevents her sharing her husband&rsquo;s
labours, or ministering to the comforts of her family, his scanty
pittance not exceeding one shilling a-day, save the help derived
from friendship&rsquo;s gifts or dole of charity, or what his
children (into whose minds he had carefully installed those
principles of right and industry) could earn by cow-tending and
other <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>casual employment, the younger ones collecting the knobs
of wool found in the sheep-walks, which the elder ones would in
the evening card, clean, and spin, and either dispose of to
persons inclined to purchase, knit into stockings, or send to
Potterne or Cheverill villages in the vicinity, where a weaver or
two resided, and have it wove into blankets, or flannels for
petticoats.&nbsp; Boys and girls would accompany the father, and
assist him to keep the sheep from the corn.&nbsp; He it is who is
to commence a local reformation, both by his own example and
precept, introducing the Gospel, whose divine light and effects
are to spread and diffuse themselves around and onward through
subsequent years&mdash;yes, even into the boundless region of
that world of immensity&mdash;Eternity.</p>
<p>In the year 1717, in a very mean and humble cottage at
Littleton Wells, a hamlet of West Lavington, dwells a man of
lowly occupation, a shepherd, <span class="smcap">David
Saunders</span>.&nbsp; Beneath this roof an immortal being
commences his career; an event which, when viewed aright, is
calculated to awaken thoughts of deep import even when
unconnected with any remarkable circumstances, how much more so
when results of infinite moment follow.&nbsp; No portentous
predictions foreshadow his future course; the probability is that
the paternal lot will be his, and peasant toil with
poverty&rsquo;s hard crust his only heritage.&nbsp; Infancy and
youth in their common every-day occurrences are past, and to him
the barest modicum of instruction is afforded probably at the
dame school of the village.&nbsp; He learned to read and write,
beyond those rudimentary aids he does not advance; the situation
his father fills requires his early assistance and help; he
becomes an under-shepherd, and mid the variations of heat and
cold, rain and snow, wind and sunshine, his frame becomes nerved
to life&rsquo;s rough path.&nbsp; He rises to man&rsquo;s estate,
and quitting the subordinate situation takes <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the head;
whether this was before his father&rsquo;s death or after, is not
quite certain; it is, however, an authenticated fact he did
succeed his father, and remained on the same farm upwards of
thirty years, although during that time the property more than
once changed hands; it was the same as is now occupied by Mr.
Hooper.&nbsp; He married Lydia Bishop, and reared a family of
sixteen children.&nbsp; His wife died in the year 1789.</p>
<p>David Saunders, the individual of whom we now speak, or as he
is more generally designated on account of his piety, the pious
Shepherd of Salisbury Plain, was early brought under the
itinerant labours of some of the followers of John Wesley; at
what exact period is not known.&nbsp; On one occasion going to
hear a Methodist preacher, probably at Imber or Seend, with a
young man, one of their society, he complains of a painful and
distressing disease, to which from early life he had been
subject, which not only caused him great trouble but was regarded
by him as a great affliction (the leprosy).&nbsp; His companion,
while compassionating his case, took occasion to remind him that
he was afflicted with a far worse disease, that not only
afflicted his body but ruined both body and soul, making it
loathsome in the eyes of a pure and holy God, and entailed upon
it eternal misery; recommending him instantly to apply to the
great Physician for that balm which alone can effect a perfect
cure.&nbsp; Thus made acquainted with the Gospel, he continued
the pursuit until he was brought to a full realisation of its
power: the sincerity of his profession evidenced itself by the
anxiety awakened in his mind with reference to the condition of
those around him; for, as was stated at the commencement of this
section, the religious state of the neighbourhood was awful and
alarming; he was a light in a dark place, and as was said of the
church of Pergamos, &ldquo;Thou <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>dwellest where Satan&rsquo;s seat
is.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pains and penalties awaited those who dared to
think and act in opposition to the authorised teachers, and to
disturb the heavy gloom that rested on the public mind; for at
this time the same person held the two livings of East and West
Lavington.&nbsp; The statement in the tract published by the
Religious Tract Society would lead to the formation of a high
estimate of the piety of the neighbourhood and the resident
clergy; there is nothing whatever to warrant this, quite the
reverse, and would apply to times of a much later date.&nbsp;
There is also a very great inaccuracy as to the shepherd being
placed in the situation of parish clerk, and removing to the
house of his predecessor, where a Sabbath school is reported to
have been commenced under the auspices of the vicar and Mr.
Johnson, who was no other person than Dr. Stonehouse, the
projector of the Infirmary at Salisbury and the resident surgeon
there, but having been unsuccessful in his treatment of a
small-pox patient, which affected his reputation and very much
depressed him, he quitted the medical profession and took holy
orders; the living of the two Cheverills, which were then united,
being presented him by Earl Radnor.&nbsp; And it is further
stated those individuals established a day school for a few girls
to be instructed by the shepherd&rsquo;s wife, who was
incapacitated for out-door employment, being heavily afflicted
with the rheumatism.&nbsp; These facts are utterly false; she was
chiefly employed in visiting and nursing the sick, being the only
person in the parish at that time able to do so: this employment
she continued till a short time before her death.&nbsp; It is
true the doctor was a great friend to the shepherd and his
family; and when down here, which was principally in the winter,
he would frequently have him to dine with him at the parsonage as
a special mark of his esteem.&nbsp; He gave him a small bible,
which is now in the possession of <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>the Rev. Mr. Wilton, of West
Lavington, and which was kindly lent to the Author for exhibition
at the jubilee.&nbsp; He remained a Wesleyan to his death; of
this he would sometimes boast, saying, &ldquo;I am a Wesleyan to
my back-bone;&rdquo; and he never quitted the house where he was
born until death.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">His early efforts&mdash;Appearance before a

Mill&mdash;Death&mdash;Funeral&mdash;Inscription.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Denied</span> the spiritual enjoyments so
abundant in the present day, which it is to be feared from their
very abundance are slighted, he was accustomed to repair
sometimes in the daytime, when he could leave his flock in the
care of another, but especially in the evening after the toils
and fatigues of the day, to Seend, probably where some of his own
people might be found, and unite with them in devotional
exercises, returning the same night, that so he might be ready
for his daily duties, so strict was he in regard to the rights of
others, and lest his good might be evil spoken of.&nbsp; He soon
began to collect a few of his neighbours beneath his natal cot,
at first at the time of his morning and evening orisons, and on
the evening of the Sabbath, for the purpose of reading the
Scriptures, singing and prayers, doubtless he would exhort them
to seek the salvation of their souls, as appears to have been the
case from his own confession in the instance that
follows:&mdash;He was once summoned before a magistrate by one of
the overseers of the parish, who, by his officious interference,
sought to gain the approbation of those above him, upon the
charge of not only allowing but himself preaching in his own
house.&nbsp; Would he have been so active if he had carried on a
course of evil and seduced others to sin?&nbsp; I trow not.&nbsp;
When questioned on the subject by the bench, he replied,
&ldquo;May it please your worship to hear what I have to
say.&nbsp; I think it my duty to pray with my family night and
morning, and if opportunity permit, to read part of the Word of
God to them.&nbsp; On Sunday mornings we rise an hour or two
before I go to my <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>sheep, that we may spend a little more time than on
other days in the worship of God.&nbsp; Some few of my neighbours
frequently come in and join us.&nbsp; We first sing a psalm or
hymn, I then read a chapter or two of the bible, and sometimes I
endeavour in my poor way to explain their meaning, we then
conclude our Sabbath morning&rsquo;s exercise with prayer to
God.&nbsp; As for preaching, I never attempt any such thing, but
leave it to those who are called to preach.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
justice, who was a clergyman, reproved the persecutor and
accuser, and admonished him to go and follow so good an
example.</p>
<p>On Littleton downs he erected a hut for his own and
others&rsquo; accommodation when the weather was bad; (this was
blown down in a violent hurricane of wind, but was afterward
rebuilt of firmer material, viz., brick, and made more convenient
by his friend, Dr. Stonehouse).&nbsp; Beneath its roof, when the
flocks were placed in safety, he would collect the shepherds and
shepherdesses (for there were several at that time owing to the
deficiency of male persons to do the work), and read to them from
the Bible, or rather commentary, now in the possession of Mrs.
Bartlett, of Cheverill, and after talking with them would engage
in prayer.&nbsp; One now living (1855), then young, has stated
that no one knew where he put the bible after reading, as she
with others often searched but could never find it.&nbsp; He
would sharply reprove the idle and careless, and then encourage
them to diligence in some way or other, saying, &ldquo;we cannot
expect young ones to be old ones, I was young myself
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the other efforts which he put forth for the good of
those around him was the opening of an evening school, where he
taught such as desired it to read and write.&nbsp; Finding his
house too small to accommodate his increasing family, but
especially for those who came to hear and be instructed, he
obtained <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>the one adjoining, which he chiefly devoted to this
purpose.&nbsp; A gentleman by the name of Bartlett, frequently
invited him to his house; he had a son, an infant, who engaged
the shepherd&rsquo;s particular attention; and it is remarked,
when at Cheverill, he would never leave the house until he had
knelt at the cradle of the babe and poured out his soul in
earnest supplication for his eternal welfare.&nbsp; Upon the
death of the shepherd, that child, risen to the state of youth,
appropriated the money that had been given him and which he had
suffered to accumulate, to the purchase of the family bible,
still in the possession of his widow, and which the Author has
seen; it was a commentary, doubtless published by Wesley at the
commencement of his public career, soon after leaving college;
the date is 1751.&nbsp; He also bought the sheep-bells and two
pet lambs, the last he ever kept, which was a privilege allowed
by flock-masters to their shepherds.&nbsp; A view of the hallowed
spot where this good man abode, and where stood the cot within
which he first drew his breath, may be obtained to peculiar
advantage, attended with great picturesque beauty (as if nature
would do honour to his memory), from a field adjoining Ladywood,
just beyond the grove which is approached through the churchyard;
a spot of which a respectable gentleman, formerly occupying an
important position in the Independent church of this place, was
wont to speak in terms of the highest praise.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can
never pass this spot,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;without stopping to
admire its peculiar beauty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doubtless the eye, the
inlet to the soul, was instrumental in producing associations of
the most pleasing character bearing upon the man and events whose
history we are now recording, and contemplating those probable
results which time would develope.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It was a favourite saying of the shepherd&rsquo;s when any one
was disposed to stint a child or children in <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>food,
&ldquo;Cut your last loaf as cheerfully as the first, they are
growing and want plenty of victuals, if God sends children he
will send bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes when his daily allowance of bread, for this was the
staple of his food, became very dry and hard, he would put it
into the pond where his flock watered as he passed to the fold,
intending after he had finished to return and take it out.&nbsp;
On one occasion, having made the deposit, his companion (his
dog), influenced by the spirit that often governs his betters,
proved treacherous and false, slyly slinking behind he approached
the place and appropriated the coveted morsel to satisfy his own
selfish appetite, in obedience to the universal law, &ldquo;Take
care of Number One.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon becoming acquainted with
his loss, and to him it was likely to prove a great privation, as
the probability was he must go without food all day, he made his
case known to his companions, one of whom, Mary Shore (who was
under him for several years), pressed him to accept of hers, as
she should not want it, having brought a double portion that day
and already eaten sufficient: upon her repeated assurance to this
fact he took it, pleasantly remarking, &ldquo;Never mind, the
dog, poor fellow, was hungry, and dogs want food.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Exposed as he was upon the downs to some of those awful
manifestations of the Divine power in thunder and lightning, he
was never known to exhibit the least fear or alarm as to himself;
this did not arise from a stoical apathy or thoughtless
hardihood, but a calm composure and preparedness of mind for the
Divine will.&nbsp; He would say, &ldquo;I am ready whenever it
pleases God to call me, here or elsewhere, and I do not care
where they bury me, they can bury me here if they like,&rdquo;
alluding to the hut before mentioned, near which he was
standing.</p>
<p>Although religion in humble garb is apt to meet with reproach
and persecution, yet in the case of <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>this lowly follower of the Saviour
there appears a mysterious charm, an immortal &AElig;gis thrown
around him, by which he was shielded from the many and bitter
sufferings that often surround the disciples of Christ, and which
awakened towards him respect and affection, not only of his own
immediate class, for some that knew him have testified he was a
right-down good man and there is no David Saunders now, but also
of his superiors far and wide; a circumstance which he appears to
have improved to advantage, not to himself or his family, but for
the good of others and the glory of God, as he said, &ldquo;There
is not a house in the parish in which I have not engaged in
prayer,&rdquo; in which exercise he manifested a strong
temperament, a blending of confidence and enthusiasm bordering
upon simplicity.&nbsp; The following is an instance:&mdash;Prior
to a journey to the neighbourhood of Bath, he was led to engage
in prayer with his youngest daughter Sally, then near her time;
after commending her to God, he prayed that the child might be a
boy.&nbsp; Soon after he reached the place of his visit he
received intelligence of the birth, and finding it was according
to his wish he immediately retired to return thanks to God for
answering his prayer.&nbsp; His mind was also tinctured with a
belief in the supernatural.&nbsp; On one occasion he had been to
Seend; on returning, he passed near to a house reputed to be
haunted; hearing a noise his curiosity was awakened, and on
approaching to reconnoitre, a voice (doubtless of some person
engaged thereabouts) accosted him with &ldquo;What doest thou
here?&rdquo;&nbsp; This he supposed to be a reproof from above,
which led him immediately to quit the spot: and it is said he
never after would go out of his direct road for anything.</p>
<p>Having relatives at Eastcote, he would sometimes walk over
there on the Sabbath afternoon, calling upon the several
cottagers in his way and invite them <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>to come and hear the Word of God,
devoting the time of his visit to a meeting similar to those he
held at his own home.&nbsp; This place has continued to have
services held on the Sabbath, and forms an out-station to
Lavington, which is regularly visited alternately with Easterton,
a hamlet noted for the indolent and vitiated character of the
inhabitants, as far as it relates to the soul, if indeed they
ever think about it.</p>

<p>In a short time similar meetings were held at Cornbury Mill,
situated in Spring road, then in the occupation of Mr. John
Gauntlett, the grandfather of the individual of that name now
resident here, who with several other branches of the family are
still identified with the cause of the Redeemer.&nbsp; The humble
shepherd devoted his efforts and energies both at home and here
to form a spiritual fold.&nbsp; On the mornings of the Sabbath he
would gather the sheep and lambs of Christ, such as under the
influence of the Spirit hungered and thirsted after
righteousness&mdash;feed them from the pasture of God&rsquo;s
Word&mdash;lead them to the fountains of still
waters&mdash;direct and comfort the burdened and heavy laden with
the precious promise of salvation.&nbsp; How long these continued
is not exactly known.&nbsp; The honoured servant of the Lord,
labouring under the increasing infirmities of age, especially
lameness, probably the consequences of that disease he in early
life suffered from, as also blindness, which for two or three
years he experienced, he was unable to go far from home.&nbsp;
Some friends who held him in high respect, residing at Wyke, near
Bath, sent for him and desired him to pay them a visit.&nbsp; It
was while here the messenger was sent to invite him to the home
of his Heavenly Father, a release he had long anticipated from
the toils of this wearisome world.&nbsp; On the night before his
death he had engaged with the family in their devotions, and
afterwards in his <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>own room with unusual and extraordinary fervency.&nbsp;
Sleeping with the son of his host he spent some time conversing
on the things of God and eternity until his voice was silenced in
sleep&mdash;a sleep from which he was not to awake till the
Archangel&rsquo;s trump shall tell the great day of the Lord
draweth nigh.&nbsp; Blessed servant who was found watching; his
last work on earth talking of heaven.&nbsp; His remains were
removed to his own habitation at Littleton, and attended to their
last resting-place by a vast concourse of spectators and
friends.&nbsp; At his grave a request was presented to the
officiating clergyman, the vicar, for permission to sing over his
remains, he replied, &ldquo;When I have done my part you may do
as you like,&rdquo; upon which, singing and prayer were engaged
in on the sacred spot, for &ldquo;precious in the sight of the
Lord is the death of his saints,&rdquo; so also is their dust
purchased as the body is with the soul by the Redeemer.</p>
<p>The place where he was laid is near the north-east corner of
West Lavington church, where a stone having a circular head, was
erected to his memory by a subsequent vicar, the Rev. E. Caswell,
from the proceeds of a small work containing letters and other
pieces, the production of John Saunders, his grandson, for the
benefit of his mother.&nbsp; Three of his sons, who formed part
of a family of sixteen, served in the armies of their
sovereign.&nbsp; The following is the inscription on the
stone:&mdash;</p>

<p>Upon opening the adjoining grave lately (April, 1855) that of
the shepherd&rsquo;s gave way, and laid bare some human bones,
which, from their remarkable size (he being of large stature and
muscular build) were supposed to be his; they were returned to
their kindred earth.&nbsp; It was remarked by the Author&rsquo;s
informant, &ldquo;If we had lived in the days of shrines and
relics, what a favourable opportunity would have been afforded,
and what a popular subject this! but such times have passed
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stone, which was in a decaying state, has,
by the order of his grandsons, Messrs. J. and J. Chapman, been
renovated.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that the humble abode where he
first drew his breath, and where his voice was so often heard
instructing his own family with others in the highest of all
human learning, holiness of life, inciting them by his precept
and example to breathe after heaven, a spot where began a
reformation that has since pervaded the neighbourhood around, and
doubtless had some influence in the Established Church, should,
with the hut on the downs, like all mundane things, have suffered
under the ravages of the iron tooth of time and covetous
innovation (about two years since it was razed, and in its stead
four brick tenements erected).&nbsp; But if the cot has
disappeared, the site remains, and will be regarded with
veneration for ages to come.&nbsp; It is on the top of a lane,
known as Saunders&rsquo;s Lane, leading from Littleton to Russell
Mill, just opposite the fields.&nbsp; May the relatives with the
inhabitants of this locality <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>be favoured to breathe the same
hallowed Spirit as its long-gone tenant, and by drinking at the
spiritual fountain that refreshed his soul realize those
blessings he so largely enjoyed.&nbsp; The nearest of his
descendants now living are the Messrs. Chapman before referred
to, and Mrs. Holloway, their sister, of Littleton.</p>

DAVID SAUNDERS.</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Thy</span> name be
honoured, though the<br />
Historic bard no mention make of thee<br />
For deeds of prowess on the battle field;<br />
Nor science nor philosophy a garland drop<br />
Upon thy brow for vast discoveries in the fields of art;<br />
Nor record hand thee down to latest age,<br />
A politician, cunning, crafty, deeply skill&rsquo;d<br />
In schools of wily usage, who by tricks<br />
And fraud, his own or country&rsquo;s weal extends;<br />
Or by a lineal descent of princely worthiness<br />
Didst occupy a throne, or place upon thy head<br />
A jewell&rsquo;d coronet.&nbsp; Thy ignoble birth, thy mean<br />
Estate, thy humble occupation, thy poverty,<br />
May perchance excite a laugh, a sneer,<br />
A scorn; but thou shalt honoured be.<br />
E&rsquo;en now the young, the aged shall pronounce<br />
Thee blest; and when the high and potent<br />
Things of earth shall sink to dust,&mdash;thou!<br />
Thou shalt shine bright like a star in the<br />
Cerulean vault! and in the heavenly sphere<br />
Shalt form a centre of intelligence; while<br />
Around thee gather thousands yet unborn<br />
To own thee parent and the consecrated<br />
Means of all they hope or do enjoy.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, honoured thou shalt be,
for thou<br />
Didst fear thy God and serve thy generation;<br />
Thou hast done good service in the noblest<br />
Cause,&mdash;hast fought the direst foe in thine<br />
Own person; and in the hearts of others didst<br />
Incite to deadliest hate, not against human<br />
Kind, but against sin,&mdash;the fruitful source<br />
Of mortal ills, of deep dishonour to the<br />
God of heaven, the poignancy of sorrow&rsquo;s tear,<br />
And the perpetual wailings of the lost.<br />
The science, the philosophy acquired and<br />
Taught by thee, was love to God, goodwill to<br />
Man; while the great mystery brought forth to light<br />
Was love incarnate, and the grace, the bliss<br />
That follows from the Cross.&nbsp; The Cross received<br />
By faith, a purifying principle within<br />
The heart,&mdash;its light&mdash;its life.&nbsp; This was the
policy<br />
Much prized by thee; how to obtain eternal bliss:<br />
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>That bliss
thou&rsquo;st gained, and though to frail<br />
Morality, allied by common lot, its various<br />
Ills (perverse inheritance) didst feel; yet<br />
By the power of sov&rsquo;reign grace, in thee so strongly<br />
Shewn, to heaven&rsquo;s high only Lord thou art affianced;<br />
And to thee a throne, a crown, a sceptre, and a robe<br />
Belong,&mdash;nay, already are possessed, and ever will<br />
Be thine; thou shalt still enjoy them when<br />
Monarchs, kings, and lords, with all their<br />
Royal pomp shall shrink to nothingness,<br />
And envy those who poor were rich in faith<br />
And heirs of God.&nbsp; Thus may e&rsquo;en a shepherd<br />
Gain a lasting true distinction.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the ingatherers of the
precious seed<br />
So long ago cast forth in faith, now honour thee<br />
As God&rsquo;s own instrument, by which the awful<br />
Gloom&mdash;spawn of satanic power that here fell<br />
Thickly&mdash;was dispersed.&nbsp; The eyeball of the<br />
Blind bid upward look on heaven&rsquo;s own orbs&mdash;<br />
The Sun of Righteousness, whose heavenly light<br />
Diffuses through the heart&mdash;the vital principle<br />
Of life.&nbsp; The deaf to hear the music of the<br />
Spheres,&mdash;nay, His voice that wakes the dead.<br />
The stammering tongue, the tongue of blasphemy<br />
And foul deceit, accustom&rsquo;d to an oath,&mdash;to bless<br
/>
His name, to speak His praise, or mercy seek<br />
For sins brought forth to light; or blessings needed<br />
To continue in the strait and narrow path.<br />
The troubled heart to find the peace, the joy,<br />
The hope, the balmy influence springing<br />
From the life, the death, and exaltation<br />
Of Him, the sinner&rsquo;s friend; and here<br />
Each commence that song sung by<br />
The ransomed choir of heaven.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Immediate Results&mdash;Rev. H. <span
class="smcap">Gauntlett</span>&mdash;Cottage
Services&mdash;Persecution&mdash;Anecdotes.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the immediate results of the
Shepherd&rsquo;s toil (which, owing to the erratic and wandering
character of human existence, &ldquo;for man continueth not in
any stay,&rdquo; may be cast to the very ends of the earth), we
gather this much: two of the sons of the owner of the mill were
brought to the knowledge of the truth, and to feel the
sanctifying power of religion, so that the scenes before
described, and in which they had largely participated, were
relinquished and abandoned, and a great interest felt in the
growth and promotion of all that was &ldquo;pure, lovely, and of
good report.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of them it could be justly said,
&ldquo;Old things have passed away, behold all things are become
new.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was mainly through their instrumentality a
room in the mill was allowed for the meetings for reading and
prayer on the Sabbath mornings.&nbsp; Another who probably from
this humble teacher beneath this roof first heard the simple tale
of the scenes of Calvary as revealed in the Gospel, of him it
might be said, in the language of God to Cyrus, which will be
manifest as we proceed, &ldquo;I have called thee, though thou
hast not known me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having engaged, by his
intelligent look and manner (which for one in his situation was
considerable) the attention and notice of the lady at Clyffe
Hall, Mrs. Vince, she advised him to devote his entire time and
attention to study for the office of the public ministry; for
this purpose he placed himself under the instruction of Dr.
Stonehouse, at Cheverill (before referred to), and, after
continuing there a suitable time, obtained ordination (the
qualifications for which were not so high as at the present
time), he became <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>curate at Imber and Tilshead.&nbsp; On one or two
occasions he preached in the church of this place.&nbsp; His
discourses, though not evangelical, were much superior in quality
to that usually afforded, and excited considerable attention:
this may in some measure be accounted for by the spirit of
inquiry that had resulted from the labours of the shepherd.</p>
<p>He afterwards was led to clearer views of Divine truth, which
vastly enlarged his sphere of usefulness, and made him a great
blessing, not only in his own parish, but in the neighbourhood
around, and when we find that he frequently attended the meetings
afterwards held in the cottages to be named, there cannot be a
doubt but he was made a chosen vessel of mercy.&nbsp; Having on
one of those days denominated Saint&rsquo;s days, probably being
disengaged from personal duty, come over to Lavington to hear the
vicar, it is remembered after the service visiting his father,
then living, his mind was in a remarkably perturbed state, and,
walking the room under great excitement, he remarked with solemn
emphasis, &ldquo;If you continue to hear such preaching as I have
heard this morning, and are satisfied with it, you will all be
lost.&nbsp; The Gospel must be introduced by some means or
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor did it rest in mere declamation, for he
with others immediately devised measures for the accomplishment
of the wish; he waited upon the Rev. R. Sloper, of Devizes, and
entreated him to adopt means to introduce the truth.&nbsp; He
afterwards removed to Reading.&nbsp; It was his lot to experience
the truth of the Divine word, &ldquo;He that will live godly must
suffer persecution.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he left Tilshead the
ringers, whether at the instigation of others or not is not
certain, rang the bells to ring him out; and who does not know
what that means?&nbsp; Well had it been for them to have pondered
the kindred spirit manifested by the Jews when they exclaimed,
&ldquo;His blood be upon us and upon our children.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>published a work of considerable acumen on the
Revelations of St. John.</p>
<p>As a further confirmation of the good accomplished by these
combined exertions, in which was associated a humble but pious
individual of the name of Wastfield, who resided at Imber, and
frequently came over and preached in the Market Place, on a stone
that formerly stood at the corner of the butcher&rsquo;s shop, as
did also some others whose hearts were stirred within them, when,
like Paul at Athens, they saw the place given to idolatry of the
most debasing character.&nbsp; Among these was a Mr. Williams,
who was much persecuted, and obtained the cognomen of
&ldquo;Jehovah,&rdquo; from his frequent use of that term of the
Almighty, and the &ldquo;Dearly Beloved,&rdquo; from his
affectionate entreaty when urging home upon his hearers the
momentous concerns of the soul.&nbsp; From these labours of faith
and love many were aroused to concern; and such &ldquo;as had
tasted that the Lord was gracious, and felt the powers of the
world to come,&rdquo; made it their practice to repair regularly
to Devizes on the Sabbath morning, taking with them their
provisions for the day, that so they might remain the afternoon
services, &ldquo;For the Word of God was precious in those
days,&rdquo; and of them it might literally as well as
spiritually be said, &ldquo;they went from strength (company) to
strength,&rdquo; each succeeding traveller or group overtaking
the preceding one, until by their mutual blending (and like the
disciples going to Emmaus, they talked of the things concerning
their everlasting welfare by the way; and who can doubt but that
their risen and exalted Lord would commune with them), until at
length they appeared before God in Zion.&nbsp; But the true
effects must be left for time to develope, and the full extent of
the benefit can only be disclosed by the light of Eternity, when
at the last great gathering of the precious fruits of the Sun it
shall be found &ldquo;this and <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>that man were born here,&rdquo; and
when the righteous Lord, whose decisions will be according to
truth, shall make up His jewels, and acknowledging the efforts
and labours of His humblest servant, reward every man according
to his work.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It was to be expected that these privileges, though so scanty,
and which were highly prized, should produce in their minds an
earnest and growing desire for the increase of the means of grace
to themselves, and also for the benefit of those around them,
especially of their own flesh and blood, as many would from
family and other circumstances be prevented availing themselves
of the public ordinances which they enjoyed.&nbsp; Now, in the
apostolic writings such a feeling is given as one criterion of a
renewed state, &ldquo;To do good unto all men, and especially
those of the household of faith;&rdquo; for them as yet nothing
had been prepared; they were prompted to special exertion, and
their first step was to obtain a room where an evening service in
the week could be held, and when they could obtain the assistance
of some minister from the neighbourhood, this was done, a cottage
(chiefly through the instrumentality of the Rev. Mr. Gauntlett,
before alluded to) situated in Parsonage Lane (now in the
occupation of Hannah Love, a member of the Church) was obtained,
William Smith was then the occupant: here, it is believed, a
regular service was commenced.&nbsp; Such proceedings excited in
the public mind warm and bitter persecution.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
enemies of all righteousness, the children of Belial,&rdquo;
manifested open hostility, every method was devised to upset
their proceedings.&nbsp; They injected into the room where they
were assembled, through every available avenue, various
substances of filth, disgusting and f&oelig;tid effluvium, as
rotten eggs, stale wash, asafoetida, &amp;c.&nbsp; In this
honourable employment the exciseman stationed here was one of the
most violent and bitter.&nbsp; <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>The people dwelling next door,
themselves hostile to religion, were open aiders and abettors,
being prevailed upon by the gift of spirits and malt liquor to
increase the annoyance by pouring these filthy accumulations down
the chimney.&nbsp; Finding that the friends amid all these
assaults displayed no disposition to retreat or yield, but an
heroic determination in humble reliance on the Great Head of the
Church to maintain their ground, and, if possible, make inroads
upon the territory of the Prince of darkness, they proceeded a
step further, blocking up the ventilation, and darkening the
apertures for light, assailing them with all the known but
indescribable sounds of discord, both vocal and instrumental,
uttering the most disgusting and opprobrious epithets, and
insulting them personally as they came to and fro.&nbsp; Still,
no cry for quarter, no compromise was even whispered by the
followers of the despised Redeemer, they not only remembered it
was uttered by Him when on the earth, &ldquo;If they persecute me
they will also persecute you,&rdquo; and &ldquo;these things will
they do unto you because they know not the Father nor me,&rdquo;
but they counted it an honour to share in His sufferings.</p>
<p>The storm, without losing any of its general character or
being drawn off or diverted from the associated body, made itself
felt in its individual power.&nbsp; The ties of family
connexions, of friendship and acquaintance, and even of business
transactions, were broken up; and where before the nod of
recognition, the hand of friendship, and the salute of
relationship was given, now the sly averted look, the curled lip,
the knitted brow, told plainly and unmistakeably the bitterness
of spirit, the malevolence of soul dwelling within; but upon none
did it beat with more violence and vehemence than the humble
tenant of the house, who soon felt it in its own native
malignity, and that, too, with the sanction <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and influence
of parties moving in the so-called respectable walks of life, by
which they sought to crush and ruin him.&nbsp; What pleasure does
the carnal mind feel when, under the direct control of the god of
this world, it vents its venom on those who, by their life,
portray a virtue of which the other cannot boast?&nbsp; He was
required either to discontinue the services in his house or to
give up possession, supposing thus to cow the spirit of one whose
daily maintenance depended on his honest toil.&nbsp; They had
recourse to promises, persecutions, threats, and
intimidation.&nbsp; He manifested the true spirit of Christian
heroism, for although he never exhibited what some would term a
decided proof of a renewed heart, being of a timid and retiring
temperament, rather courting the secluded shade than the open
blaze of publicity, which rendered the temptation more fierce and
trying, yet his unimpeachable rectitude, his moral propriety, his
constant and lively interest in the prosperity and progress of
the cause, his steady adherence to it through the fiery ordeal,
and his happy death, justify the conclusion that silently the
sacred seed had vegetated; and ultimately he received the end of
his faith, the salvation of the soul.&nbsp; Alluding to the fact
here stated, when visited in his last affliction and in the near
views of eternity, he expressed himself thankful that he was not
allowed to yield to the temptation, but was enabled to do as he
had done, for with the Apostle &ldquo;he conferred not with flesh
and blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Conscience dictated and he obeyed her
voice, gave up the cottage regardless of ulterior consequences
(for he had been told by his employer that he should visit with
his heavy displeasure his persistance in such conduct), and
having one of his own in White Street, which stood on the site of
Mr. Hayward&rsquo;s surgery, he removed thither, carrying the ark
of God with him, thus nobly consecrating his house to the service
of religion.&nbsp; Was <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>not this the spirit of the ancient
believer who said, &ldquo;As for me and my house we will serve
the Lord&rdquo;?&nbsp; What an example is here presented, a noble
sacrifice worthy of all honour, which nothing but the conviction
of the goodness of the cause in which he was embarked could
enable him to fulfil.&nbsp; Verily the blessing he sought he was
permitted to realize, for &ldquo;God, who is not unrighteous to
forget the work of faith and labour of love,&rdquo; has left it
on record for all to the end of time, &ldquo;Them that honour me
I will honour.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was afterwards elected to the
office of clerk and sexton of the chapel, which he filled with
credit for several years; dying in a good old age in the year
1847.</p>
<p>The vicar being determined to suppress these irregular
proceedings, as he denominated them, probably imagining as all
clergymen do, they are the only authorised instructors of the
people, used all his influence, and having secretly encouraged
those low assaults previously recorded, but which to his chagrin
had been unable to shake them from their purpose, now proceeded
to open remonstrance.&nbsp; He placed a person to watch the
arrival of the expected minister, who from some cause or other
had been delayed; his anxiety to do what he thought God&rsquo;s
service, got the better of his patience, or perhaps fearing his
emissary might fall under the evil influence of bad example,
repaired thither himself.&nbsp; The person acting as precentor
had commenced the service by singing, and was preparing to read
the Scriptures, when he was stopped by the rev. gentleman (who
had no fear of being cited into the Ecclesiastical court for
brawling) and severely reprimanded for his conduct, and
admonished to go home and not disturb the quiet of the place by
such disorderly proceedings.&nbsp; By this time the minister had
arrived, and the intruder, either alarmed at his antagonist, or,
it is to be hoped, ashamed of his conduct, withdrew, and <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>left the
assembly to the enjoyment of their evening&rsquo;s
exercise.&nbsp; The following day he was waited upon by two
Dissenting ministers from Devizes, and in his turn received
reproof and admonition.&nbsp; Not at all relishing the interview,
he made it as brief as possible, and gladly bowed them from under
his roof, remarking to some one near, &ldquo;If they preach as
they talk, I do not wonder the people go to hear
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Satisfied with one visit he never coveted or
sought another, and though he did not approve, he would not again
by his own overt acts bring himself into collision with
them.&nbsp; Well had it been for him to have learned wisdom of
the Jewish Sanhedrim, &ldquo;Let these men alone, for if the work
be of God ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found to fight
against God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A blacksmith in White Street, a worshipper of the jolly god,
Bacchus, on one occasion, after the indulgence of copious
potations, entered the place where they were assembled, and
endeavoured to interupt the service.&nbsp; Having come in the
extreme liberality and charity of his warm heart earnestly to
expostulate with what he considered the deluded people,
especially the minister, whom he evidently imagined to act under
the impulse of sordid motives, begging him not to disturb the
peace of the village, saying, &ldquo;If it is want that leads you
so to act, here,&rdquo; said he, and accompanying the word with
peculiar action, he drew from under his leathern apron or some
capacious pocket a large piece of bacon, adding, &ldquo;If you
want something to eat, here is some for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; We can
only hope that he may have been brought to see and know that
&ldquo;Man cannot live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceedeth out of the mouth of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> little despised band of
Christians, amid all the evil influences at work for their
dispersion, were much encouraged by the continued success that
attended them.&nbsp; Had the Established Church provided better
spiritual food it is probable the growth of Dissent at best would
have been very slow and weak; and had she, instead of the
bitterness everywhere manifested, employed more conciliatory
means, it would have tended materially to retard the progress of
events, which the course pursued rather accelerated by producing
conviction of error, and hence leading to a perusal of that
volume which is and ever will be the only statute book of the
court of hearers, to which duty they were specially and earnestly
directed for a solution of all difficulties, a solver of all
doubts, and the only safe guide in all practical matters.&nbsp;
They were much encouraged and assisted by many of the ministers
from the surrounding Churches.&nbsp; The Rev. Robert Sloper, of
Devizes, who especially took the infant cause under his fostering
wing, and hence during his ministry regarded it as part and
parcel of his own particular charge,&mdash;a kind of out-station
to the Church of that place.&nbsp; Mr. Honeywell, of Melksham,
was also very kind to them, visiting and encouraging them as
often as his duties at home would allow.&nbsp; Mr. Jackson, of
Warminster, and Mr. Sibree, of Frome, were frequent visitors
here.&nbsp; The latter would invariably have a service on the
Monday morning early before he returned home; and it is believed
was the means of doing much good.&nbsp; And <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>there was the
then youthful Jay, of Christian Malford, a name that will
doubtless continue in the remembrance of the Christian Church for
years to come.&nbsp; Some of his earliest pulpit productions were
delivered here; he consequently ever after felt a deep interest
in its progress and prosperity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed,&rdquo;
that about this time several persons of respectability were
induced to attend; doubtless various motives were in
operation&mdash;some were attracted by the juvenility of the
preacher, Mr. Jay; others with the simple yet melting piety of
Mr. Sibree; and a third class would desire to hear what this new
doctrine or sect was which was everywhere spoken against; of many
it will be remarked, they were in the way, and the Lord met
them&mdash;&ldquo;a timid, feeble, youthful hand may pull the
string, but an Unseen One guideth the arrow,&rdquo; brought to a
saving knowledge of the truth; they &ldquo;laid hold of the
skirts of Him that was a Jew saying, we will go with you for God
is with you,&rdquo; and cast in their lot with his people.</p>
<p>An onward course was now imperative; the next step was to
organize a Christian Church&mdash;a good sign when it springs not
from the spirit of faction and wish to appear something but from
a healthy action&mdash;a desire to keep the commands of Christ,
and become local centres of influence, lights to diffuse the
Gospel.&nbsp; Such we trust were the feelings that animated the
first band here&mdash;a desire to promote their own individual
well-being and the glory of God.&nbsp; Their tried and constant
friend, Mr. Sloper, met them in conference, and making every
proper inquiry, agreed to form them into a distinct body.&nbsp;
Having laid before them the laws of Christ, the Great Head of the
Church, by which they were to be governed, and to regulate their
daily conduct, walk, and conversation, promising to preside over
them <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>whenever his duties at home would allow.&nbsp; The
following persons then gave and received of each other the right
hand of fellowship:&mdash;</p>

<p>The two last-named persons are the only ones remaining, the

</a></p>
<p>In the year following, feeling their strength increase,
&ldquo;waxing stronger and stronger,&rdquo; they proceeded to
make provision for the young around them, fully entering into the
spirit of that great truth which has since been so extensively
carried out, viz., &ldquo;that the future hope of the Christian
Church must be the young,&rdquo; they opened a school on the
Sabbath for boys in the bakehouse of Mr. Gauntlett, the corner of
Parsonage Lane, under the joint supervision of that gentleman and
Mr. Joseph Ward, and one for girls at the old parsonage house, a
little way up the lane, where Miss Saunders had a seminary for
young ladies.&nbsp; This lady took the superintendence of that
department: what were the numbers of the pupils and teachers
there is now no record.&nbsp; These things continued until the
purchase of the chapel, and the schools were removed thither,
when Mr. Saunders (who with his sister about this time joined the
Church) took the superintendency of the whole.</p>
<p>We cannot suffer an occasion like the present to pass without
according to the memory of that gentleman the respect due to him
for those efficient services he rendered.&nbsp; The energy of
mind, the <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>business-like habits, the sanctified talent, the
spontaneous generosity, the unflinching rectitude, and the
unwavering firmness which so strikingly formed his character, he
brought to bear upon the prosperity not only of the school, which
for forty years he presided over with unvarying regularity and
constancy, never during that lengthened period been five minutes
beyond his time, but the cause of the Redeemer generally, which
in its various departments found in him a warm supporter, and
especially that part of it with which he was immediately
connected as an office bearer.&nbsp; Many now risen to take part
in the activities of life can bear testimony to the tender
amenities, the affectionate solicitude, persevering and patient
assiduity by which his instructions were characterised.&nbsp; We
deeply deplore those events and circumstances which, under the
mysterious arrangements of Divine Providence, have withdrawn the
several members of his family from this locality, and thus denied
the Church of one of his descendants upon whom the Paternal
mantle might have fallen to supply his place, and hand down his
name, zeal, piety, and energy to future generations.&nbsp; We
trust that that family will continue to feel a deep and lasting
interest in the prosperity of this our Zion.</p>
<p>From the continued accessions made and the decline of those
prejudices and animosities which had so long vexed them from
without, it became absolutely necessary that increased
accommodation should be provided.&nbsp; Numerous difficulties at
first presented themselves, every attempt to obtain suitable
premises or a plot of ground eligible for the erection of a
chapel was abortive.&nbsp; After waiting some time, the
meeting-house belonging to the Friends before referred to,
situate at the east end of the town, was to be disposed of: such
a favourable opening naturally created a wish to possess the
long-desired boon.&nbsp; A correspondence upon the subject <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>was opened,
and after due deliberation and counsel it was determined to
embrace the offer, and the property was delivered over in trust
for the especial use and service of the Church and congregation,
under the denomination of Independents, of the P&aelig;do-baptist
persuasion, subject to certain conditions as to the right of the
Friends to its use occasionally if required.&nbsp; These
documents, with subsequent ones, are now placed in the custody of
the County Association, who have provided a safe repository for
such papers.&nbsp; It was a square building built of rough stone,
having brick quoins, and a brick front on one side abutting on
the street, a narrow lane conducting to a cottage running at the
back, the other side and front standing in the graveyard,
enclosed with a stone wall; the admeasurement of which is 23 ft.
by 39 ft., that of the building 33 ft. by 22 ft.&nbsp; Some
considerable alteration was requisite to fit it for its intended
purpose, a pulpit and desk being necessary; these having been
accomplished, the place was opened by two public services; that
in the morning by the Rev. Josiah Bull, of Newport Pagnell, and
that in the evening by their warm friend, the Rev. William Jay,
then settled at Bath.&nbsp; Most of the neighbouring ministers
attended and united with them in the joy of that auspicious
event,&mdash;the possession of a sanctuary of their own.&nbsp;
They still continued dependant on foreign aid for the supply of
the pulpit until about the year 1806, when the question of a
regular established pastorate was mooted, especially as their
much and deservedly esteemed friend felt the infirmities of
advancing age coming upon him, so as to require additional help
at home.&nbsp; The Rev. R. Sloper was unable to give them that
assistance so desirable.&nbsp; This subject was one calculated to
produce disunion, and painful as it is to contemplate, yet
justice requires it should be told,&mdash;sad proof of the
imperfection of human nature, even under the professed
sanctifying <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>power of the Gospel, the truth so long foretold by the
Apostle became exemplified, &ldquo;Whereas there are among you
divisions, and strifes, and contentions.&nbsp; For while one of
you saith, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, and I of
Cephas, and I of Christ, are ye not carnal?&rdquo;&mdash;it
ultimated in open rupture and separation, not only of the Church
and congregation, but also of the Sabbath school, under Mr.
Christopher Garrett, who withdrew, he and his followers, to a
cottage situated in the lane near the weighing engine.&nbsp; A
barn which stood near was afterwards pulled down, and the cottage
enlarged to the size of the present building, from that time
known as the lower chapel.&nbsp; The separatists have continued a
distinct body of close communionists holding Baptist principles,
from whom have since seceded the other body assembling in the new
chapel in White Street, erected by Miss Husband.</p>
<p>In the year 1809, the portion of the Church that remained at
what was then denominated the Upper Meeting, still desirous of a
settled minister, chose Mr. Richard Ward, one of their number,
and called him to the sacred office of pastor.&nbsp; Considering
it desirable to his standing among the ministers, they proceeded
to a public designation of him, and invited the pastors of
neighbouring Churches to unite with them and recognise the mutual
engagement.&nbsp; The usual and varied services were gone through
embodying the profession of faith, the principles of Dissent, the
nature of the Gospel Church, the imposition of hands, and the
charge to the minister elect, with advice to the Church, in which
various parties were engaged.&nbsp; He continued to labour among
them with great acceptance until the year 1818, when the
infirmities of age coming upon him, he relinquished his
office.&nbsp; The attendance was much increased under his
ministry, and several were added to the Church.&nbsp; It was
during this period an <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>addition was made of a gallery, which
was soon filled, and an enlargement of the building rendered
necessary; this was accomplished to the extent of 20 ft., its now
present dimensions, rendering it capable of accommodating about
500 persons.&nbsp; By these alterations a heavy debt was
incurred, and remained a burden until the time of the Rev. T.
Sturgess, in the year 1829.&nbsp; Mr. Ward lived several years
after his resignation, and died in 1839, full of years and faith;
he was interred in the burying ground adjoining, nearly opposite
the lower door.</p>

<p>He was followed by the Rev. Mr. Slade, a young man who was
educated for the ministry at the Dissenting College at Newport
Pagnell, under the Rev. Josiah Bull; and in the year 1818 was
ordained according to the usual manner among the Churches of the
denomination, but only continued with them till when, from an
inability to please some who were fastidious, he resigned, and
removed to Corsham, where he has continued ever since with
comfort and honour to himself and advantage to the people of his
charge.&nbsp; May he long continue, be made an increasing
blessing, and with them richly enjoy the benediction of the Great
Head of the Church.</p>
<p>In the following year the Rev. John Guard, then supplying
Portland Chapel, Bath (a new Independent interest which it was
attempted to raise to meet the wants of the extensive population
of that city, but from the want of encouragement in certain
quarters failed) was, from the recommendation and with the advice
of the Rev. Wm. Jay, invited as a supply and, being approved of,
he was requested to accept the vacant pastorate: he entered upon
it in the year and continued to fill it till 1827, being
constrained through the occurrence of some trying and unpleasant
circumstances to relinquish his charge.&nbsp; Although he passed
through the ordeal unscathed and with a clear conscience, yet he
was much bowed <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>down in his spirit, and felt his soul keenly sensitive,
deeply lacerated.&nbsp; From hence he removed to Wickwar, in
Gloucestershire, where he remained a few years, then went into
Hampshire, where the cause being in a very low and unpromising
state, and there appearing but very little prospect of its
reviving, he did not remain long, but removed to Mavagessy, in
Cornwall.&nbsp; How long he continued here is not exactly
known.&nbsp; The next account of him is, that he returned to
Overton, in Hampshire, and soon after terminated his trying
pilgrimage.</p>
<p>The removal of this servant of the Most High had an injurious
effect upon the cause.&nbsp; The circumstances alluded to
produced a great convulsion; the Church became divided, part
spake one thing and part another, these bitter waters of strife
ended in a temporary separation, and those who left occupied a
room near the weighing engine.&nbsp; The Rev. Thos.&nbsp;
Williams, who about twenty years before had visited the town and
preached in the Market Place, then residing in London, was
visited by an influential member of that party, with whom he had
previously become acquainted, invited to come down, and settle
among them, which he did, although he afterwards much regretted
that step, being, as he said, misled in the representations made
to him as to the state of affairs.&nbsp; The pulpit at the chapel
being filled by casual supplies and some of the resident friends,
after about six months the breach was healed, and the two parties
re-united, when Mr. Williams became the pastor of the whole
body.&nbsp; Unhappily the calm was of a treacherous character,
and the sky soon put on a very portentous and ominous
appearance.&nbsp; The echo of discord broke upon the ear, and
instead of the sweets of harmony and heavenly fellowship, a union
of purpose and aim, the unhallowed conflict and strife of party
domination, so uncongenial to increase of grace, became apparent;
the good man&rsquo;s <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>peace of mind was destroyed, and his
usefulness impaired.&nbsp; After remaining a little more than a
year, he closed his engagements with them, and withdrew to the
lower chapel.&nbsp; He died in the year 1835, and was buried in
the ground belonging to that place.&nbsp; A tablet was erected
within the chapel to his memory.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about this time and in some
measure owing to the above proceedings that the chapel at
Littleton (known as the Cross-roads meeting) was erected upon the
site of a cottage and grounds purchased for that purpose, which
was put in trust for the use of the Independents, and though
never actually attached to the cause at Market Lavington, yet
mainly dependant upon the friends of that place and occasionally
supplied by the minister, its chief reliance is upon lay
agency.&nbsp; A proposal was made to take it under the direction
of the church here (in 1854), as it was thought likely to promote
its success, but as opposition was made thereto by one of the
trustees, the attempt was relinquished, and they are left to
their own resources.</p>
<p>From this, in the year 1839, a party seceded and formed
themselves into a distinct body embracing Baptist views, and
built Ebenezer chapel upon ground given by the Earl of
Radnor.&nbsp; They have never been able to maintain a minister,
but are dependant upon lay agency.</p>
<p>In the year 1829, an invitation was sent to the Rev. Thomas
Sturgess, then settled at Melksham, requesting him to supply the
pulpit at Lavington; at the termination of his probationary
visit, he was requested to settle over them.&nbsp; He complied
and took up his abode among them.&nbsp; Alas! how varied are the
forms of evil, and how diverse are the phases in which it can
appear; just as are the dispositions of the human mind so will
there be found an adaptation in error, in perfect accordance with
the nature <a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>of the reptile so fitly chosen as an emblem of the
author of all evil, &ldquo;The serpent,&rdquo; as one of our
poets has expressed it, &ldquo;takes a thousand forms to cheat
our soul to death,&rdquo; compression or dilation, the assumption
of any device or colour, just as suits his purpose, so that the
progress of truth be impeded.&nbsp; We have before noted how one
after another of the servants of Christ have been constrained, by
sinful perversity of their people, with wounded hearts and
streaming eyes, to vacate their post; but now the scene somewhat
changes, and the cause is to be assailed in a more vulnerable
point.&nbsp; Ruin hovers over it, and how deliverance is to be
obtained or from what quarter it is to come is a mystery.&nbsp;
The debt arising from the enlargement in the time of the first
pastor, and which had been suffered to continue, presses upon
them, and assumes the form of a Chancery law suit: the property
is attached, and the people are quite inadequate to combat it;
but as all who are acquainted with law well know that as far as
the defendant is concerned, it admits of no delay, but if
allowed, like a leech, will glut itself with the very vitals of
life.&nbsp; The people put forth their utmost efforts, and then
made application to the Wilts Association of Independent or
Congregational Churches for assistance.&nbsp; Having no funds
available for this purpose at their disposal, they recommended
the case to the Churches of Christ generally&mdash;the minister
of the place travelling the county to solicit their aid.&nbsp; It
was his privilege soon to realise the object which enabled him to
discharge the debt by which the suit was stayed.&nbsp; He
remained till 1834, when he removed to Marlborough, where he
continued some time, then left for Sidmouth, and afterwards for
Collumpton.&nbsp; In a few years he relinquished the stated
ministry, and removed to the North of England.&nbsp; For the
space of two years they remained without a shepherd, in a great
measure arising from <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the diversity of temperament the
human mind everywhere exhibits, and in no case more so than in
matters of religion, especially in the democratic cast of the
Dissenting Churches, which is an evil to be deplored, as too
often affording to one individual the opportunity of governing a
Church through the power of influence exerted over minds
incompetent to a just discrimination of things; yet, when
compared with the other evil resulting from the concentration of
power in one individual, in the form of patronage is much to be
preferred, as less likely to be injurious to truth.&nbsp; To the
reflecting mind, the fact herein advanced will receive abundant
confirmation in the diversity of creeds and professions with
which the Christian world abounds, causing more animosity and
heart-burning than any thing else, and from which very few
Churches have escaped.&nbsp; During this interregnum their
reliance was chiefly upon neighbouring ministers and what lay
agency could be made available, which, unless judiciously
employed, will of itself be productive of evil, by exalting some
aspiring mind beyond his proper sphere.</p>
<p>In 1836, the Rev. John Young was recommended and at their
invitation settled among them, but after about twelve
months&rsquo; residence, owing to some unpleasant affair of a
personal nature, he deemed it advisable to retire.&nbsp; Recourse
was then had to ministerial friends far and near, and that for
the space of about five years; during which they enjoyed
comparative quietness and prosperity.&nbsp; In 1841, those who
preferred a resident ministry to the dissipating mode of mere
supplies (which, however pleasing to such as admire variety, is
not the best for promoting true genuine piety and a steady
progress in the path of holiness; nor is it calculated to foster
some of the sweetest and tenderest of associations&mdash;those
between pastor and people), made an effort to realize their wish;
when the Rev. J. S. <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>Gilbert was chosen to be their minister with very
encouraging prospects; but the fairest day may have its
clouds.&nbsp; A misunderstanding arose relative to his
ordination; and although every means were used to overcome the
difficulties&mdash;much as his friends regretted the issue,
seeing he was not likely to be comfortable, they advised him to
withdraw, and with great reluctance he complied.&nbsp; The
managers, for by that name the officers were known, opened a
correspondence with the Rev. C. P. Hobbs, of Highbury College;
though at first he manifested a disinclination to accept the call
to the pastorate, eventually he agreed, and was ordained in the
year 1842.&nbsp; During his ministry the cause rose to a very
respectable position, but the varying atmosphere became again
overcast and agitated from a quarter unexpected and unlooked
for.&nbsp; Mr. Hobbs&rsquo;s views of church polity which he
publicly professed at his ordination underwent a complete
revolution; he therefore resigned in the early part of 1849, and
conformed to the Established Church: he settled at Liverpool, but
has since removed to the neighbourhood of London; and our hope is
he may be made an extensive and lasting blessing.&nbsp; At the
close of the year the Rev. C. B. Holder took the charge and
remained until 1853, when, from some unexplained cause, he
followed in the wake of his predecessor; and after for a time
vacillating between the Establishment and Dissent, as the fane of
interest varied, he at last accepted the office of Scripture
Reader under the Bishop of Manchester, with the promise of
eventual ordination.</p>
<p>The secession of these successive pastors, after solemn
averment of having well considered the opposite principles of
Church government, and selecting that from conviction of its
scriptural truthfulness, was very naturally calculated to shake
and overturn the faith of many, and give cause for <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>rejoicing to
their enemies.&nbsp; The removal and death of some of their
warmest and best friends about the same time tended very much to
depress the Church and engender a state of languor.&nbsp; But
hopes are entertained that the tide has turned, the crisis
passed, and an amendment commenced.&nbsp; The present number of
members is fifty.&nbsp; It had been the wish of many of the
friends for a considerable time past to improve the singing, and
if possible to avoid those fruitful sources of evil which many a
devout mind has had to deplore and too often caused discord, by
the erection of an organ.&nbsp; The promising appearances which
have arisen since the settlement of the present minister (this
took place at the fall of the year 1853), seemed to afford a
favourable opportunity for its accomplishment.&nbsp; A committee
was accordingly formed for this express purpose; and after a
general canvass so much encouragement was experienced, that terms
were entered into for one every way suitable for the sum of
&pound;40.&nbsp; Steps were immediately taken for its erection,
and it was opened in December of the same year, when sermons from
Psalm xlvii. 7, were preached by the pastor.&nbsp; The ladies of
the congregation exerted themselves to provide new cushions for
the pulpit and desk, and curtains for the organ gallery and
windows.&nbsp; About the same time a pupil of the
minister&rsquo;s, by the productions of his pencil, not only
gratified the friends with drawings of the interior and exterior
of the chapel, but by the sale of these purchased a hot-air
stove, which he presented to the Church.</p>
<p>On Good Friday, April 6th, 1855, a balance remaining as a debt
for alterations necessary, and the period of a little over fifty
years having elapsed from the first establishment of the Church,
a jubilee tea-meeting was held, which was very numerously and
respectably attended: a great many friends came from Devizes and
the neighbourhood around.&nbsp; The <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>place was tastefully decorated with
evergreens for the occasion.&nbsp; At the back of the pulpit was
placed a perpendicular rectangle, in the centre of which was
suspended the quotation of Scripture, Heb. xiii. 7, 8.&nbsp; On
either side of the pulpit were arches with similar inscriptions,
taken from Ps. cxxii. 7, and Ps. lxxxiv., 1.&nbsp; In front of
the pulpit was hung a drawing of the shepherd, on the frame of
which was:&mdash;&ldquo;The memory of the just is blessed,&rdquo;
the date of his birth and death with his age.&nbsp; In front of
the organ, was a double arch with single mottoes of &ldquo;Fear
God,&rdquo; &ldquo;Honour the King.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pillars of
the gallery having branches of laurel were surmounted with
similar inscriptions of,&mdash;&ldquo;Love the
brotherhood,&rdquo; &ldquo;Honour all men,&rdquo; &ldquo;Unity,
and dwell in love.&rdquo;&nbsp; About 200 sat down to tea at four
o&rsquo;clock; after ample justice had been done to the abundant
repast provided, a public meeting was held, when George W.
Anstie, Esq., of Devizes, was invited to preside.&nbsp; The
pastor read the history now given, which was received with marked
approval; he also exhibited the pocket bible of the shepherd and
two manuscript letters lent for the occasion; after which several
persons addressed the meeting.</p>

saints,&rdquo; and aim to perpetuate the cause of the Redeemer,
whose beginning though small has in its progress received marks
of His divine hand, that generations yet to come, while they do
honour to the memory of the Pious Shepherd of Salisbury Plain,
may be folded by each under pastor, and at last owned by him the
great Shepherd of the Sheep, when each local society of believers
shall, by the powerful and purifying influence of &ldquo;the
Truth,&rdquo; lose each minor peculiarity which now marks them,
and generate a spirit of separation, unite in one universal,
redeemed, and glorified Church, to place upon the head of their
adored Redeemer the diadem of many crowns, uniting in the hosanna
of a happy universe, saying, &ldquo;Thou art worthy, for Thou
hast redeemed us to God by Thy blood.&nbsp; To Him be glory,
honour, majesty, and power for ever.&rdquo;</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
